        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-600">History Of Software</h2>
        <div class="mt-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
            <p>In the crisp spring of 2023, I returned to Nepal after years abroad, eager to reconnect with my homeland. The bustling streets of Kathmandu greeted me with their familiar chaos—vendors hawking spices, rickshaws weaving through traffic, and the scent of momos drifting from corner stalls. But as I wandered through the labyrinth of small retail shops, a stark contrast struck me: every merchant, from tea sellers to hardware dealers, meticulously logged transactions in weathered register books, their fingers stained with ink. Not a computer in sight.</p>

            <p>Curious, I asked my cousin, Sunil, who ran a family provisions store, why digital tools weren’t used. He sighed, "Some tried, but the software here is either too costly or too complicated." Dealers echoed his frustration—existing systems required expensive licenses, frequent updates, and hardware shops couldn’t afford the chaos. For Nepal’s mom-and-pop stores, technology felt like a distant luxury, not a tool within reach.</p>

            <p>One evening, over steaming cups of <strong class="text-amber-600">chiya</strong>, Sunil joked, "Why don’t <em>you</em> build something?" His words lingered. That night, I rallied a few tech-savvy friends—Bina, a UI wizard, and Raj, a coding maestro. Our mission: craft a solution as simple as a register book but with the power of modern tech. We built a prototype and named it <strong class="text-blue-500">"Sahaj" (सहज)</strong>, meaning "simple" in Nepali. But during testing, something unexpected happened.</p>

            <p>At Sunil’s shop, a customer quipped, "This software feels like a <strong class="text-green-600">free lunch</strong>—no cost, no headaches!" The phrase stuck. Merchants loved that it saved them time and money, even letting them finally take proper lunch breaks instead of wrestling with ledgers. We realized "Sahaj" captured simplicity, but <strong class="text-green-600">"Lunch Free"</strong> embodied freedom—from cost, complexity, and wasted hours. We rebranded, turning a local joke into a rallying cry.</p>

            <p>Today, "Lunch Free" thrives in over 200 shops across Nepal. It’s more than software—it’s a movement. At a tea stall in Pokhara, I recently overheard a vendor say, "Without ‘Lunch Free,’ I’d still be chasing numbers instead of playing with my grandkids." As the Himalayas watched silently, Nepal’s smallest businesses proved that progress doesn’t need pomp. Sometimes, it just needs a name that feels like a friend.</p>
